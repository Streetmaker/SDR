    Tutorials on the GNU Radio Wiki
    PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP using Python
    Software Defined Radio Academy youtube channel
    https://wirelesspi.com/
    RTL-SDR Blog: Software defined radio news and projects.
        Includes some tutorials, but mostly I recommend this for:
            Inspiration (they post cool news), or
            To buy a real (non-counterfeit) RTL-SDR.
    Ettus SDR Tutorials
    Wave Walker DSP
        Many tutorials. Fairly mathy. Some good foundational info too, such as:
            Why are Sinusoids used in DSP and RF?
            Signal and Noise: The Vocabulary of RF
    Morse code example
    FM Reception with the GNU Radio Companion: Great tutorial. Includes:
        How to listen to FM
        How to get the digital data (current song name, etc)
    Gnuradio Mini Projects: A variety of projects.
    DSP Illustrations: DSP using Python.
    "But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles | DE4" Has cool animations. Pretty heavy math.

Other cool stuff:

    "Kid krypto": Public Key encryption: Don't let the name fool you -- this is the best explanation of Public Key Encryption that I've seen. It does require some reading, but it well worth it. Also see source and an interesting subsequent work

    Error checking:
        Two dimensional parity
        Hamming code (interesting; more advanced)

        When GNU Radio Companion is tuned to a radio station, graph ("sink") shows similiarity to the groove on the record?

Not as cool, but worth saving for other reasons:

    Behind the Veil: A Peek at GNU Radioâ€™s Buffer Architecture -- This explains why the size of a chunk-of-data-provided-to-a-block varies.
