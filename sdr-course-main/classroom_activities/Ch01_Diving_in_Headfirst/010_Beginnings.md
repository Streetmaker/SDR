Before starting:
- Create a folder for yourself with your name (and no spaces) on the Desktop.
  - We recommend that you create a directory for each exercise number to keep things organized. This is especially helpful when you reach the exercises that use Embedded Python Blocks, as they generate helper files.
- Change the TMOUT as you did in the python course.

Go to [this tutorial page at GNUradio.org](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials) (https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials).

Work through the "3. Your First Flowgraph" tutorial (in upper-left) together as a class. 

There are a few common pitfalls that the instructor will demonstrate:

- When using the "save" dialog in the Ubuntu GNOME desktop environment, it's easy to accidentally search instead of typing the file name.
  - Solution: Click in the file name field before typing a file name.
- When you are searching for blocks, there are odd behaviors if you have a block selected.
  - Solution: Be extra careful to deselect blocks before searching.
  - Solution (alternate): always press Ctrl+F before typing.
- When editing the "Properties" of a block (Access these by double-clicking or right-clicking the block):
  - When you scroll, you may accidentally scroll above the arrow of a drop-down menu, which changes the contents.
    - Solution: Scroll with your cursor on the left side of the window.
  - The `Apply` button is buggy: it will sometimes NOT apply the changes, such as if you use it twice in a row.
    - Solution: Don't use the "Apply" button. Press "Ok" instead.

Some useful keyboard shortcuts in GNU Radio Companion:
  - Ctrl + F : Find blocks
  - D : Disable a block
  - E : Enable a block
