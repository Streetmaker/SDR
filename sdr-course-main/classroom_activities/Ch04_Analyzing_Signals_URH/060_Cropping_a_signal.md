# Interpret a signal using URH üìª

- Launch urh and open your project folder.

- Click on the Interpretation tab at the top of the urh window.

- Download the following file (link provided) from github ![unknown_signal_3.complex](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch04_Analyzing_Signals_URH/unknown_signal_3.complex).

- Put it in your urh project folder.

- Click and drag the signal and drop it to the right (On the Interpretation tab).

- Clean up your `noisy` signal by adding a filter like in the previous lesson

- Determine signals `modulation` type as in previous lesson.

- The next thing we need to do is set the `Center` like the previous lesson.

- Determine signals `Samples/Symbol` as in previous lesson.

- Crop your signal to eliminate leading zeros.
    - Since we know our preample starts with a `1` now we can highlight everything past the first `1` in the bits window.
