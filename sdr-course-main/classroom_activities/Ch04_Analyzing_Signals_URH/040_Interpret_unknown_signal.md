# Interpret a signal using URH üìª

- Launch urh and open your project folder.

- Click on the Interpretation tab at the top of the urh window.

- Download the following file (link provided) from github ![unknown_signal_1.complex](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch04_Analyzing_Signals_URH/unknown_signal_1.complex). (click to go to the linked page, and download from there.)

- Put it in your urh project folder.

- It should now look something like this:
    - You may have other files showing than the ones you see here.

- On the left side you should see the signal you received.

- Click and drag it to the grey space on the right to begin interpretation.

- Looking at the signal try to determine whether it is ASK, FSK, or PSK modulation.

- Looking at the signal try to identify a single `0` or `1` and highlight it.
    - You may need to zoom into the signal to see it more clearly.
    - It is actually easier to select just a single `0` or `1` in the bottom window but this may be inaccurate because your Samples/Symbol setting may not be correct.

- When you highlight a portion of the signal urh will tell you how many samples you have selected like in the above image it says right below the highlighted portion "50 selected".

- If you actually highlighted a single 1 or 0 then we can now change our settings to 50 Samples/Symbol and 1 Bit(s)/Symbol.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Your signal may be different than this example.

- Now ensure your settings are correct:
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Your settings may be different than this example.

- If you did everything correctly you should now see your secret message (it will be different than the message shown below).
